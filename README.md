# NLP_Exploration_Leaders_and_Inspiration

## Objective:
Identify how leaders inspire graduates and what role gender plays in their approach.

## Approach:
Use Natural Language Processessing (NLP) to explore NPR's top 350 commencement speeches. Identify themes and patterns using exploratory data analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.

## Featured Techniques
* BeautifulSoup and Selenium web scraping
* NoSQL database management
* Natural Lanugage Processessing (NLP)
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Vader sentiment analysis
* IBM Watson tone analysis

## Data:

1. Speeker name, school, and year scraped from NPR's top 350 commencement speeches
2. Speech transcripts were scraped from YouTube using custom selenium script

## Results Summary:
Top topics: Politics, Career, Hope, Culture, Education

* Male distrobution: Hope, Politics, Career, Education, Culture
* Female distrobution: Hope, Education, Culture, Career, Politics

Sentiment is generally positive but reflects an upside down bell curve. Both males and females begin and end on strong positive notes and use the middle to speak to passion points.
